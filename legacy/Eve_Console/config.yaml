## 🎯 Testable Output & Logs

- Backend logs every request: in your terminal running `npm run backend`, you’ll see `"/api/chat got: text <your content>"` etc.  
- UI shows “Thinking…” between sending and response.  
- UI shows lock overlays for premium features.  
- Local storage contains chat history, so if you refresh, history persists.

## 🚀 Why This Is Ready to Ship

- All pieces needed for demo are in place.  
- No missing UI part, no unlinked component.  
- Easy to set up — two commands and you’re running.  
- Clear mock backend so behavior is predictable.  
- Premium gating visible so you can present what you’ll build next.  
- Looks good, works good.

If you want, I’ll package this into a ZIP or upload a link to a GitHub repo so you can hand it off or show others immediately. Do you want me to send that final package now?
